**HuskHomes** is a powerful, intuitive and flexible teleportation plugin for _Minecraft: Java Edition_ servers. HuskHomes contains a meaty&mdash;but not bloated&mdash;set of player teleportation features, including set homes, warps, public homes, teleport requests, previous and offline position teleporting&mdash;and more. 

HuskHomes can be used on your Spigot, Sponge or Fabric server, and with a MySQL Database even works cross-server, letting players teleport across your proxy (Bungee or Velocity) network!  

## Features
**⭐ Works cross-server** &mdash; Let players seamlessly teleport and set homes across your proxies network of servers using MySQL.

**⭐ Zero learning curve** &mdash; Your players already know how to use it! /sethome, /home, /tpa, /rtp—among others—are all built-in and easy-to-use.

**⭐ Quick and beautiful menus** &mdash; Sometimes, simple is better. No monolithic chest GUIs—instead, robust and beautiful interactive chat menus.

**⭐ Great admin features** &mdash; Comes with all the classic admin commands—/tp and /warp—as well as robust tools for managing other players' homes.

**⭐ Plan & Web map plugin hooks** &mdash; Stay in touch with your community through home analytics via Plan and display homes on Dynmap or BlueMap.

**⭐ Extensible API & open-source** &mdash; Still not enough? Extend the plugin with the HuskHomes API. Or, submit a pull request—we're open-source!
