**HuskHomes** is a powerful, intuitive and flexible teleportation plugin for Spigot-based Minecraft servers. The plugin supports a wide array of features; from teleporting between players, teleport requests, public and private homes, warps, random teleporting and more. 

All of this is supported on standalone and cross-server setups; players can set home and teleport on and between multiple servers on a proxy network.

## Features
**⭐ Works cross-server** &mdash; Let players seamlessly teleport and set homes across your proxies network of servers using MySQL.

**⭐ Zero learning curve** &mdash; Your players already know how to use it! /sethome, /home, /tpa, /rtp—among others—are all built-in and easy-to-use.

**⭐ Quick and beautiful menus** &mdash; Sometimes, simple is better. No monolithic chest GUIs—instead, robust and beautiful interactive chat menus.

**⭐ Great admin features** &mdash; Comes with all the classic admin commands—/tp and /warp—as well as robust tools for managing other players' homes.

**⭐ Plan & Web map plugin hooks** &mdash; Stay in touch with your community through home analytics via Plan and display homes on Dynmap or BlueMap.

**⭐ Extensible API & open-source** &mdash; Still not enough? Extend the plugin with the HuskHomes API. Or, submit a pull request—we're open-source!
