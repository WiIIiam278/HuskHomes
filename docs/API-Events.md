HuskHomes provides a number of API events your plugin can listen to when certain actions are performed. Most of these events are cancellable, letting you stop them from executing if you wish.

## Events on Sponge & Fabric
> **Note:** Check the [[API]] introduction for details on targeting platforms

Sponge, which has a similar Event api as Bukkit, has equivalent events for all of the above, prefixed with `Sponge` (so HomeCreateEvent on Bukkit is SpongeHomeCreateEvent on Sponge).

Fabric uses callbacks for handling events. HuskHomes provides callback equivalents for all the above events. For instance, to handle what to do when someone creates a home, you can register a callback to handle what to do as follows:
<details>
<summary>HuskHomes and Fabric callbacks</summary>

```java
HomeCreateCallback.EVENT.register((player, home) -> {
    // Do something with the player and home
    return ActionResult.SUCCESS; // Return an appropriate ActionResult
});.
```
</details>
