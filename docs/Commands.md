HuskHomes provides a range of commands for you to use. This page will detail the permissions for each command to [let you manage access](managing-access) to the plugin's different features.

## Commands & Permissions Table
This is a table of HuskHomes' commands and their required permission nodes. Additional permissions provided by the plugin to control other variables are detailed further below!

&dagger;Required permission for basic command execution; some commands require additional permissions for certain functions (See below&hellip;)

## Disabling Commands
If you'd like to disable a command, add it to the `disabled_commands` section of your config file as detailed below. Note that on servers running Paper for versions earlier than Minecraft 1.19.4, or servers just running plain Spigot instead of Paper (not recommended&mdash;please upgrade to Paper!), disabled commands will still be _registered_ but a disabled command message will appear. On servers running Paper for Minecraft 1.19.4+, HuskHomes will be registered as a Paper Plugin (and will appear as such in the `/plugins` menu) and disabled commands will not be registered at all.

<details>
<summary>Disabling a command in config.yml</summary>

```yaml
# Disabled commands (e.g. ['/home', '/warp'] to disable /home and /warp)
disabled_commands: [ '/rtp' ]
```
</details>

## Other Permissions
### Changing set home, public home & free home limits
You can modify the maximum number of homes, the allotment of free homes and the number of public homes a user can set through permission nodes.
* `huskhomes.max_homes.<amount>` — Determines the max number of homes a user can set
* `huskhomes.free_homes.<amount>` — Determines the allotment of homes the user can set for free, before they have to pay&dagger;
* `huskhomes.max_public_homes.<amount>` — Determines the maximum number of homes a user can make public

&dagger;Only effective on servers that make use of the economy hook.

If users have multiple permission nodes (i.e. from being in multiple permission groups), HuskHomes will accept the highest. If you would prefer the nodes to _stack_, you can set the `stack_permission_limits` setting in the plugin config file to `true` (under `general`).

Note that these permission-set values override the values set in the plugin config (`max_homes`, `max_public_homes` under `general` and `free_homes` under `economy`).

### Return by death on /back
This permission controls whether users can return to where they died. Note that return by death must be enabled in the config for this to work.
| Permission                     | Command | Description                           |
|--------------------------------|---------|---------------------------------------|
| `huskhomes.command.back.death` | `/back` | Use /back to return to where you died |

### Home privacy
These permissions allow you to make a home public/private (toggling its privacy). There are also permissions that let you use, edit and delete homes that have not been set publicly.
| Permission                           | Command                                                                             | Description                                  |
|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `huskhomes.command.edithome.privacy` | `/edithome <name> privacy [public/private]`                                         | Modify the privacy of a home                 |
| `huskhomes.command.home.other`       | `/homelist <player> [page]`                                                         | View a list of a user's homes                |
| `huskhomes.command.home.other`       | `/home [<owner_name>.<home_name>]`                                                  | Teleport to a user's home, public or private |
| `huskhomes.command.edithome.other`   | `/edithome [<owner_name>.<home_name>] [rename/description/relocate/privacy] [args]` | Edit a user's home                           |
| `huskhomes.command.delhome.other`    | `/delhome [<owner_name>.<home_name>]`                                               | Delete a user's home                         |

### Cooldown, warmup and economy bypasses
These permissions let you bypass teleportation warmup checks, rtp cooldown checks and economy checks
| Permission                         | Description                                |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `huskhomes.bypass_teleport_warmup` | Bypass timed teleportation warmups&dagger; |
| `huskhomes.bypass_economy_checks`  | Bypass economy checks                      |
| `huskhomes.rtp.bypass_cooldown`    | Bypass the cooldown on /rtp&ddagger;       |

&dagger;This is not effective when the teleport warmup time is set `<= 0` in the config file. 

&ddagger;This is not effective when the /rtp cooldown time is set `<= 0` in the config file.

### Advanced teleportation
These permissions allow you to use /tp and /rtp to teleport other players remotely and to coordinates.
| Permission                         | Command                                     | Description                         |
