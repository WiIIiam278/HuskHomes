HuskHomes provides a range of commands for you to use. This page will detail the permissions for each command to [let you manage access](managing-access) to the plugin's different features.

## Commands & Permissions Table
> **Command Conflicts:** If you have multiple plugins providing similar commands, you may need to [create aliases](command-conflicts) to ensure HuskHomes' commands take priority.

This is a table of HuskHomes' commands and their required permission nodes. Additional permissions provided by the plugin to control other variables are detailed further below!

* &dagger; **Base Permission** &mdash; Required permission for basic command execution; some commands require additional permissions for certain functions ([See below&hellip;](#other-permissions))
* &ddagger; **Default** &mdash; ✅ = Accessible by all players by default &mdash; ❌ = Accessible only by server operators by default.

### Command Aliases
The following commands have aliases that can also be used for convenience:

| Command      | Aliases                      |
|--------------|------------------------------|
| `/homelist`  | `/homes`                     |
| `/phome`     | `/publichome`                |
| `/phomelist` | `/phomes`, `/publichomelist` |
| `/warplist`  | `/warps`                     |
| `/tp`        | `/tpo`                       |
| `/tpaccept`  | `/tpyes`                     |
| `/tpdecline` | `/tpno`, `/tpdeny`           |

## Disabling Commands

If you'd like to disable a command, add it to the `disabled_commands` section of your config file as detailed below. Note that on servers running Paper for versions earlier than Minecraft 1.19.4, or servers just running plain Spigot instead of Paper (not recommended&mdash;please upgrade to Paper!), disabled commands will still be _registered_ but a disabled command message will appear. On servers running Paper for Minecraft 1.19.4+, HuskHomes will be registered as a Paper Plugin (and will appear as such in the `/plugins` menu) and disabled commands will not be registered at all.

<details>
<summary>Disabling a command in config.yml</summary>

```yaml
# Disabled commands (e.g. ['/home', '/warp'] to disable /home and /warp)
disabled_commands: [ '/rtp' ]
```

</details>

## Home Limits
You can modify the maximum number of homes, the allotment of free homes and the number of public homes a user can set through permission nodes.

* `huskhomes.max_homes.<amount>` — Determines the max number of homes a user can set
* `huskhomes.free_homes.<amount>` — Determines the allotment of homes the user can set for free, before they have to pay&dagger;
* `huskhomes.max_public_homes.<amount>` — Determines the maximum number of homes a user can make public

&dagger;Only effective on servers that make use of the economy hook.

If users have multiple permission nodes (i.e. from being in multiple permission groups), HuskHomes will accept the highest. If you prefer that the nodes _stack_, you can set the `stack_permission_limits` setting in the plugin config file to `true` (under `general`).

Note that these permission-set values override the values set in the plugin config (`max_homes`, `max_public_homes` under `general` and `free_homes` under `economy`).

## Other Permissions

<details>
<summary>Return to last position or death with /back</summary>

These permissions control what the user can do with the back command, including the ability to return to their last position or to where they died.

|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|:-------:|
| `/back` (after respawning) | Use /back to return to where you died&dagger;          | `huskhomes.command.back.death`    |    ✅    |
| `/back`                    | Use /back to return to your previous teleport position | `huskhomes.command.back.previous` |    ✅    |

&dagger;Note that return by death must be enabled in the plugin [[config files]] for this to work.
