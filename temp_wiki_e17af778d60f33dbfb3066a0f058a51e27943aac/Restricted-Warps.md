HuskHomes supports restricting warps behind permission nodes. This means that players require a corresponding `huskhomes.command.warp.<name>` node to view and use warps, else they will see an error message.

To enable permission-restricted warps, set `permission_restrict_warps` to `true` under `general`. Don't forget to grant users the necessary permission nodes (`huskhomes.command.warp.<name>`).
